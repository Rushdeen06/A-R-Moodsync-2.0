# ðŸŽ¯ GitHub Pages Configuration Steps

## After deploying with `npm run deploy`, follow these steps:

### 1. Go to Repository Settings
- Navigate to your repository on GitHub
- Click the "Settings" tab (next to "Code", "Issues", "Pull requests")

### 2. Configure GitHub Pages
- Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
- Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
- Branch: Select `gh-pages` (this was created by npm run deploy)
- Folder: Select `/ (root)`
- Click "Save"

### 3. Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will show "Your site is being built from the gh-pages branch"
- This takes 2-5 minutes the first time
- You'll get a green checkmark when ready

### 4. Your Live App URL
Your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/MoodTrackingApp/
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

**If you see 404 errors:**
- Wait 5-10 minutes (GitHub Pages can be slow)
- Check that the gh-pages branch exists in your repository
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings â†’ Pages

**If navigation doesn't work:**
- The app is configured for the correct base path `/MoodTrackingApp/`
- All routes should work properly once deployed

## âœ… What You'll Have

Once deployed successfully:
- âœ… Analytics Dashboard with interactive charts
- âœ… Team Members page with profiles and search
- âœ… Settings page with comprehensive options
- âœ… All navigation tabs working
- âœ… Microsoft Teams-like interface
- âœ… Data persistence with localStorage

## ðŸ“± Taskbar Integration

After deployment, run the taskbar script:
```powershell
.\create-taskbar-shortcut.ps1
```

This will create a desktop shortcut you can pin to your taskbar!
