# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## üöÄ Your Mood Tracking App is Ready for Deployment!

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Name your repository (e.g., "MoodTrackingApp")
5. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
Copy the commands from GitHub's "push an existing repository" section, or use these:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### Step 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages
Once you've pushed to GitHub, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build the production version
- Create a `gh-pages` branch
- Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select branch: `gh-pages`
6. Select folder: `/ (root)`
7. Click "Save"

### Step 5: Access Your Live App
Your app will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME/
```

‚è∞ **Note**: It may take a few minutes for the site to become available after first deployment.

## üîÑ Future Updates
To update your deployed app:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push changes to main branch
3. Run `npm run deploy` to update the live site
